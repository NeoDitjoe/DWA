 # Search function

The code is a basic HTML web page that implements a people search functionality. It provides a search form where users can enter a query, and the code will display the matching results based on the query. The search is performed on an array of people objects containing attributes like name, surname, age, gender, and race. The matching results are dynamically displayed below the search form.
